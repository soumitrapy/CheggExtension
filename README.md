# Features
1. Give notificaion (with sound) when new question is available.
2. skip/answer question by pressing a single key.

# Expected Updates
1. Option of selecting your own key, sounds etc... 

# How to add
To add the extension in your chrome broswer follow the steps described [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)

Note: Don't forget to turn on the developer mode.

# Usage
* To skip question: press **j** 
* To answer question: press **k** 

When you are working on some other thing, just keep a tab open with the question window, (it's fine if you are working on some other tab or minimized the browser) you will be notified when a new question is available.

If a typed 'j' by mistake but want to answer the question, just press 'k' immediately after 'j' it will work.

# Few issues
1. Suppose you pressed 'k' for answering the problem, but later you decide to skip, then you must use your mouse for skipping the question, not only that, **after succesfully skipping you must reload the page.** (I will solve it later)
